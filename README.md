## :dart: About ##

This a Flutter mobile app with a NodeJS backend using relational DB (MariaDB) that's directly linked to an embedded arduino project that can perform access control over building entrances.


## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: Cloud Based (GCP);\
:heavy_check_mark: Mobile app;\
:heavy_check_mark: Fingerprint recognition with arduino;

## :rocket: Technologies ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [Google Cloud Computing](https://cloud.google.com/)

## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. It's recommended to have any relational DB workbench, such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/). This is a cloud based project, but it can easily be converted to a local environment.
